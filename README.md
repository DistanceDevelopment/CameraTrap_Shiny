# CameraTrap_Shiny
Camera trap shiny app for obtaining activity rate multiplier, associated standard error and resamples from a nonparametric bootstrap, for use in camera trap distance sampling analyses.  For more information, see the [distancesampling.org `activity` page](https://distancesampling.org/software/activity.html).

This shiny app can either be downloaded to be run locally on your machine or alternatively we host it online [here](https://arts.st-andrews.ac.uk/shiny/lt5/activity/). 

Under the hood, the app uses the R package [`activity`](https://github.com/MarcusRowcliffe/activity), which is authored and maintained by Marcus Rowcliffe.  Details of the methods used are in Rowcliffe _et al._ (2014).
